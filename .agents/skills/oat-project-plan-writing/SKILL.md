# Plan Writing Contract

Defines the canonical `plan.md` format that all OAT plan-producing and plan-mutating skills must follow.

## Progress Indicators (User-Facing)

When a skill invokes this contract during plan authoring, it should print a sub-banner:

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   OAT ▸ PLAN WRITING
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This is a sub-phase indicator; the calling skill owns the top-level banner.

- When invoked by a calling skill, print the sub-banner immediately before plan authoring begins.

## Canonical Plan Format

Every `plan.md` produced or edited by any OAT skill **must** satisfy these invariants.

### Required Frontmatter Keys

```yaml
---
oat_plan_source: spec-driven | quick | imported   # origin workflow mode
oat_plan_hill_phases: []                     # HiLL checkpoint phase list (empty = every phase)
oat_status: in_progress | complete          # plan lifecycle status
oat_ready_for: null | oat-project-implement # downstream consumer
---
```

Runtime routing note:
- Keep `oat_ready_for` canonical as `oat-project-implement`.
- Use `oat_execution_mode` in `state.md` (`single-thread` or `subagent-driven`) to choose sequential vs subagent implementation flow at runtime.

Additional frontmatter keys (`oat_phase`, `oat_phase_status`, `oat_blockers`, `oat_last_updated`, `oat_generated`, `oat_template`, `oat_import_reference`, `oat_import_source_path`, `oat_import_provider`) are set by calling skills as needed.

### Stable Task IDs

- Format: `pNN-tNN` (e.g., `p01-t03`, `p02-t12`).
- IDs are monotonically increasing within a phase and never reused.
- Review-generated fix tasks continue the sequence (e.g., after `p03-t08`, fixes start at `p03-t09`).
- Heading format: `### Task pNN-tNN: {Task Name}`.

### Required Sections

Every `plan.md` must contain these sections (order may vary):

1. **`## Reviews`** - Table tracking review status per phase/scope.
2. **`## Implementation Complete`** - Summary with phase counts and total task count.
3. **`## References`** - Links to related artifacts (design, spec, discovery, etc.).

If any required section is missing when a skill edits `plan.md`, it must be restored using the template headings without deleting existing content.

### Review Table Preservation Rules

- The `## Reviews` table includes both **code** rows (`p01`, `p02`, …, `final`) and **artifact** rows (`spec`, `design`).
- Skills must **never delete** existing review rows.
- New rows may be appended (e.g., `p03` for a newly added phase).
- Status semantics: `pending` → `received` → `fixes_added` → `fixes_completed` → `passed`.
  - `received`: review artifact exists but findings have not yet been converted into fix tasks.

### Implementation Complete Section

- Must reflect accurate phase counts and total task count.
- When review-fix tasks are added, update totals immediately.
- Phase rollup counts in headings (if present) must stay consistent.

## Mode-Specific Planning Inputs

Required inputs vary by workflow mode. The calling skill reads `oat_workflow_mode` from `{PROJECT_PATH}/state.md` (default: `spec-driven`).

| Mode     | Required Inputs                                      | Design Gate |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `spec-driven` | Complete `design.md` (`oat_status: complete`)   | Yes         |
| `quick`  | `discovery.md` + repo knowledge context              | No          |
| `import` | Preserved external source + normalized `plan.md`     | No          |

- **`spec-driven`**: Plan is derived from a complete design document. All design components must be covered by tasks.
- **`quick`**: Plan is generated directly from discovery decisions and repo knowledge. No design artifact is required.
- **`import`**: External plan is preserved in `references/imported-plan.md` and normalized into canonical format. Subsequent edits follow this contract.

## Resume and Edit Guardrails

When a calling skill encounters an existing `plan.md`:

### Resume Options

Offer the user three choices:
- **Resume** (default): continue editing the existing plan in place.
- **View**: show the existing plan and stop.
- **Overwrite**: replace with a fresh copy of the template (warn about losing draft edits).

### Edit Rules

- **Never delete existing review rows** in the `## Reviews` table.
- **Restore missing required sections** (`## Reviews`, `## Implementation Complete`, `## References`) using template headings if absent — do not delete existing content.
- **Preserve existing task IDs** — new tasks continue the sequence, never reuse or renumber.
- **Keep frontmatter consistent** — update `oat_last_updated` on every edit; do not clear `oat_plan_source`.
